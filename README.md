Employee Details

## Getting Started

This is a simple Employee Details App built using Flutter. It allows users to manage employee details like name, position, and contact information, providing operations such as adding, editing, and deleting employee records. The data is persistently stored in local storage on the device, ensuring that the employee information remains available even after the app is closed and reopened.

## Features
**Add Employee:** Users can input new employee details (name, position, contact) and save them to the app.

**Edit Employee**: Users can select an existing employee and update their details.

**Delete Employee:** Employees can be deleted from the list, and their data will be removed from local storage.

**Local Storage**: Employee data is stored in the device's local storage using the shared_preferences package, making the app fully functional offline.
